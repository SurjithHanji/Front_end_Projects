        <b>Swami Vivekananda[a] (12 January 1863 â€“ 4 July 1902)</b>, born Narendranath Datta[b] was an Indian Hindu monk, 
        philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] 
        He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world.[6][7][8] He is credited with
         raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion in the late nineteenth century.
